This is a simple adaptation of [randompapers.net](http://randompapers.net) that integrates the iOS Shortcuts app.

You will need to add your [NASA ADS](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/help/api/) API key in `Random.py`

In the Pyto app (there are other options), you can use `Random.py` with this [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a6261711adc245a78a06d910131dcc84).
- I have an automation set to run the shortcut and and text myself the links/titles every morning at 5 am (yes, that is excessive (I don't read a paper everyday))
